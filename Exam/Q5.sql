--Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics ( 30 day order binary and 30 day view binary) using a interval 95% confidence. 

--For orders_bin: lift is -14% – 12% (-3.3%) and pval is 0.74
--For views_bin:  lift is and pval is -3.2% – 6.8% (2.9%) and pval is 0.46
--Therefore for item_test_2, there was no significant difference in either the number of views or the number of orders between control and experiment
